# merakiMDMPkg

A postflight script that will install a Meraki Systems Manager enrollment profile.  Also, includes a Makefile to package your enrollment profile with the postflight script.  It took me a few tries to nail down the exact identifiers for Meraki profiles so I figured this was a good thing to share.

# Thanks to:
